# How to Use Evaluation Theory, Models, and Applications for Your Projects
  
Evaluation is a systematic process of collecting and analyzing information to make judgments about the value, quality, effectiveness, or impact of a program, project, or intervention. Evaluation can help you improve your practice, demonstrate your accountability, inform your decision-making, and communicate your results to stakeholders.

But how do you choose the best evaluation approach for your situation? How do you design and conduct an evaluation that meets the standards of quality and rigor? How do you use the evaluation findings to inform your actions and communicate your value?
  
One of the most comprehensive and authoritative resources on evaluation is the book *Evaluation Theory, Models, and Applications* by Daniel L. Stufflebeam and Chris L. S. Coryn[^1^] [^2^]. This book provides an overview of the evaluation field and its standards, as well as a detailed description and analysis of 23 evaluation approaches that can be applied to various contexts and purposes.
  
In this article, we will summarize some of the key features of this book and how you can use it to plan, conduct, and assess your evaluations.
  
## What is Evaluation Theory, Models, and Applications?
  
*Evaluation Theory, Models, and Applications* is a book that was first published in 2007 and updated in 2014. It is based on the extensive experience and expertise of the authors, who are widely recognized as leaders in the evaluation field.
  
The book has three main parts:
  
- Part One: Fundamentals of Evaluation. This part covers the basic concepts and principles of evaluation, such as its definition, purpose, standards, roles, ethics, theory, types, objects, methods, and procedures.
- Part Two: An Evaluation of Evaluation. This part evaluates the evaluation field itself by identifying and critiquing 23 evaluation approaches that have been developed and used over time. The authors classify these approaches into five categories: pseudoevaluations (which are not legitimate evaluations), questions- and methods-oriented evaluations (which focus on technical aspects of evaluation), improvement- and accountability-oriented evaluations (which focus on practical aspects of evaluation), social agenda and advocacy evaluations (which focus on political aspects of evaluation), and eclectic evaluations (which combine elements from different approaches).
- Part Three: Explication and Application. This part explains how to apply the evaluation approaches described in Part Two to various situations and purposes. The authors provide examples of how to use these approaches for personnel evaluations (such as teacher evaluations), program evaluations (such as curriculum evaluations), metaevaluations (evaluations of evaluations), meta-analyses (syntheses of evaluation findings), cost-benefit analyses (comparisons of costs and benefits of programs), case studies (in-depth investigations of specific cases), experimental designs (controlled comparisons of groups or conditions), quasi-experimental designs (uncontrolled comparisons of groups or conditions), consumer-oriented evaluations (evaluations that serve the needs and interests of consumers), utilization-focused evaluations (evaluations that aim to enhance the use of findings by stakeholders), responsive/stakeholder-centered evaluations (evaluations that involve and respond to stakeholders), CIPP model (an improvement-oriented evaluation model that stands for context, input, process, and product), transformative evaluations (evaluations that aim to promote social justice and empowerment), participatory evaluations (evaluations that engage stakeholders in all stages of evaluation), empowerment evaluations (evaluations that help stakeholders develop their own evaluation capacity), collaborative evaluations (evaluations that foster collaboration among stakeholders), developmental evaluations (evaluations that support innovation and adaptation in complex environments), theory-driven evaluations (evaluations that test causal theories or logic models of programs), realist evaluations (evaluations that explain how programs work in different contexts for different people), goal-free evaluations (evaluations that assess outcomes without preconceived goals or objectives), naturalistic evaluations (evaluations that respect the natural settings and meanings of programs), fourth-generation evaluations (evaluations that negotiate claims, concerns, and issues among stakeholders).

The book also provides appendices with useful resources for evaluators, such as evaluation standards, guiding principles, checklists, glossary, references, index.
