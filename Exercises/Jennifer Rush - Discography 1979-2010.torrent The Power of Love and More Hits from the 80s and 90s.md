Rush was born Heidi Stern in New York City in 1960 and grew up in a musical family. Her father was an operatic tenor and voice teacher, and her mother was a pianist. She studied violin and piano at the Juilliard School, but preferred playing the guitar in private. She moved to Germany with her father when she was nine years old, and later returned to the US to live with her mother's family. She started her music career in Seattle, Washington, where she released her first album under her legal name in 1979.
 
In 1982, she moved back to Germany and signed a contract with CBS Songs as a songwriter. She changed her stage name to Jennifer Rush and released her self-titled debut album in 1984. The album spawned five singles, including "The Power of Love", which became a worldwide hit and reached number one in several countries, including the UK, where it sold over a million copies and broke the record for the best-selling single by a female solo artist at the time. The song was later covered by many artists, such as Celine Dion, Laura Branigan, and Air Supply.
 
Rush followed up her success with several more albums and singles throughout the 1980s and 1990s, such as "Ring of Ice", "Destiny", "25 Lovers", "I Come Undone", "Madonna's Eyes", "Heart Over Mind", "Flames of Paradise" (a duet with Elton John), "Wings of Desire", "Higher Ground", "Tears in the Rain", and "Credo". She collaborated with other artists, such as Michael Bolton, PlÃ¡cido Domingo, Brian May, JosÃ© Carreras, and Helene Fischer. She also performed at various events, such as Live Aid in 1985, Nelson Mandela's 70th Birthday Tribute Concert in 1988, and The Wall - Live in Berlin in 1990.
 
Rush has sold over 30 million records worldwide and has won several awards and honors, such as the Bambi Award, the Goldene Europa Award, the Echo Award, and the World Music Award.
